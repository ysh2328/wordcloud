* Manual Switcher - to allow your user to manually switch between desktop and mobile versions. Available in 3 versions: shortcodes, option to automatically insert into footer, or template tag.

* Based detector on [mobiledetect](http://mobiledetect.net/) project, meaning device detection will stay up to date with latest mobile devices.


= A standard mobile theme =
* Was designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your site's content in a richly presented way, sparing no essential features like search, categories, tags, comments etc.

* Device adaptation, including the rescaling of images, intelligent splitting of articles and posts into multiple pages, the simplifaction styles, and the removal of non-supported media.

* Smart Formatting: It doesn't matter whether users are viewing your site horizontally or vertically, mTheme will re-position all media on the fly.

* Full Comments System: Default wordpressor or DISQUS.

* You can choose from 8 different color schemes in the settings panel.

* Easily customize your mobile theme logo with our easy uploader.

* No SEO Knowledge Needed: mTheme will automatically optimize your site for SEO. You don't need to touch a button, just sit back and watch your rankings rise.

== Upgrade Notice ==

IMPORTANT: After upgrade, Deactivate and Activate the plugin to update the files of mobile theme.


== SETTING UP A SUBDOMAIN IS DONE THROUGH YOUR HOSTING PROVIDER ==

You need to create a CName, and unfortunately the way you do this differs from one host to another, with some it's a drop down box and it takes two seconds to do, with others the process will be a little bit more complicated.

If you use an external host somewhere there will be a section where you can edit your DNS details - if your service doesn't allow it then it's probably time to move to another host.

When you create a subdomain, you will need two things, the domain the subdomain is for and the location from which the new subdomain will load it's content.

Type your subdomain (m), that will be your mobile subdomain, then point for your website root. (don't create a extra folder) this plugin will not work if you point it to be different from the directory you installed WordPress.

To confirm that the process was performed correctly visit your full site in `m.yousite.com` (before enable the plugin)

= TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION (after enable the plugin) =

* Ideally, use a real mobile device to access your (public) site address and check that the witching and theme work correctly.

* Use the Mobile emulator in admin dashboard.

* In Firefox Browser, the [User-Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-br/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/) add-on can be configured to send mobile headers and crudely simulate a mobile device's request.
